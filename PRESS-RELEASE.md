  The fairest way for new roommates to decide who gets what room at what price

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.

  When you're moving into a new place, it's important that all your roommates are happy with the room they got, and feels like they are paying the right price for it. RentZen makes it easy to arrive at a solution everyone is happy with. Just enter your total rent, add a name and description for each room, and invite your roommates to the app. It will privately ask everyone some simple questions, and work until it has achieved perfect rental harmony, where nobody wishes they could swap rooms/rents with anybody else.

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves

  When you're moving into a new place, it's important that everyone is satisfied with their room, and feels like they are paying a fair price for it. If one room is clearly much nicer than the others, that person should pay more. But it's hard to figure out exactly who gets what room and at what price in a fair way. And if you get it wrong, resentment can build over time and ruin your roommate harmony.

  Ideally, you want an "envy-free" solution, where nobody wishes they could switch rooms/rents with anybody else. Most methods either fail to guarantee this (e.g. just set rent based on square footage), or they are too time-consuming and stressful (e.g. do a straight-up auction)

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.

  Our product uses game-theory-optimal algorithms to guarantee an envy-free solution, but in a way that is easy to use and understand for the user.

  We're combining the best features from [two](http://acritch.com/rent/) [algorithms](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/science/rent-division-calculator.html), while wrapping it all in a friendly UI that works on web and mobile. We also have features that none of the existing tools support, such as accounting for shared rooms.

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.

  "We're the first ones to make it both very easy and very fair to decide rooms and rents among roommates. Our app just asks everyone just a few simple questions, and comes up with a way for everyone to end up in their favorite room for the price."

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.

  Just enter your total rent, add a name and description for each room, and invite your roommates to the app. The app will privately send each person some simple questions to figure out how strongly they prefer some rooms over others. Once the app understands everyone's preferences, it will figure out the room assignments and rent breakdown that makes everyone the happiest.

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.

  "It was so easy, and everyone is happy with the room they got. I'm breathing easier knowing that our new house is off to a good start, and nobody wishes they were in a different room."
